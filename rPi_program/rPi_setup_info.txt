# Download setup file from GitHub:
wget https://github.com/rachelparkinson/beehaviour-lab/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

# Unzip and run:
unzip main.zip
cd beehaviour-lab-main/rPi_program
chmod +x setup_rpi.sh
./setup_rpi.sh

## ---------------------- ##

5. Log in to RealVNC to allow for file transfer
sudo vnclicensewiz

## ---------------------- ##

6. Transfer git program (from local copy via ssh)

# Fix rPi name (e.g., rPi1...) and replace <raspberry_pi_ip> with actual IP. 
# Need to be on same wifi network as rPi for this to work

scp -r /Users/user/Documents/beehaviour-lab/rPi_program rPi21@<raspberry_pi_ip>:/home/rPi21/


## ----------------------- ## 

8. Setup SSD

Connect SSD
- Connect to USB 3.0 (blue)
- wait 30s, then in Gparted select ‘GParted > Refresh Devices’ (1-2 mins)
- Select SSD (from drop-down menu at top right) and wait for the information to display

Create Partition Table
- Select ‘Device > Create Partition Table’ from top menu
- Keep default settings, select ‘Apply’ (wait a few mins, might not look like anything’s happening)

Create Partition
- select ‘Partiton > New’ from top menu
- Keep all default settings (including the ext4 filesystem), but add a sensible Label to help identify it later on (e.g., ‘WDSSD’)
- Select ‘Edit > Apply All Operations’ from the top menu and click yes to the warning once you’ve checked everything (may take some time)

Run ssd_setup.py

cd ~/rPi_program
chmod +x ssd_setup.sh    # (only needed once to make it executable)
./ssd_setup.sh
